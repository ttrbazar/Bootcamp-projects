# React Wikipedia Search

In this Project you will use wikipedia api to search anything you want.

Let’s get started!

If you have a working React path already (or you just created a new one):

Change your original “src” folder with the Project’s “src” and run your application: npm start

Your goals are;
- When you enter something and hit the button, at least 10 results should come from wikipedia.
- Use function components only and states also.

## STEPS:

## 1.
>`https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=opensearch&search=SEARCH-WORD&format=json&origin=*&limit=10`

In your App.js file; inside App function component use this url to fetch data from wikipedia. Create handleData() helper function.

## 2.
Take “SEARCH-WORD” from your form component from “form.js” file.

## 3.
In your App.js file, according to the returning data; list wikipedia results to the DOM.
