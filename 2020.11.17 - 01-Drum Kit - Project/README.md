# DRUM KIT

## Purpose: To practice DOM

There is a drum kit application for childs. You have seven clickable drums and their voice.

But page is broken and not working. Try to fix it. 

## 1. 
First create a variable drum1 that reaches first drum.

## 2.
Assign drum1 clicking expression to an empty arrow function.

This function will make sound when button is clicked. 

## 3.
Inside this function ;

Make the sound active. Look at your Project folder, you found sounds for each drum.

HİNT: usage; “new Audio("somesound.mp3").play();”

Start your function and see if it is working.

## 4.
Now you can make this for all drums but do not.

Create a variable that takes all drums at the page. Use querySelectorAll. This will gives you an array consist of all drums.

Now you can create a for loop for each element in that variable. 

İnside this for loop create your onclick function and make all sounds working properly. You can use button values to manipulate (reach and play) sounds. (Or use innerHTML values)

## 5.
Refresh your page and see if your game is working when you are clicking the buttons. 

## 6.
Now your game is ready to play but there is something else to do: Keypress. 

Some users want to control drums by using keyboard.

## 7.
Create an event listener to the DOM. This time use “keypress” or “keydown” instead of “click”. It will gives you the key pressed on the keyboard. (Off course inside the event)

Inside this function print your keys pressed by keyboard to the console. Make sure you got the correct keys.

## 8.
Now write your script to run each sound according to the key. 

## 9. CHALLENGE
There is no effect in your game.

Use same event listener to create an animation function. When user pressed the key, related button will take the class of “pressed” that has been already created in .css file. 

And also don’t forget to remove this class automaticaly after a short while.
