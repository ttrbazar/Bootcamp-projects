# OXYGEN LEVELS:

Many years into the future, a team of Space Voyagers find their ship is low on Oxygen and need to dock somewhere safe while they call home for help.
  
Their computer detects a list of nearby planets that have Oxygen in their atmosphere. It has produced an array of their Oxygen levels.

To be safe to land on, a planet needs to have an Oxygen level between 19.5% and 23.5%.

1. Write a function that finds the first safe oxygen level in each array.

2. Write a function that finds the all safe oxygen level in each array.
