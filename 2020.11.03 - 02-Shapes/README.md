# SHAPES WITH N SIDES

1. 

Create an object that keeps geometric shapes. Keys are amount of sides and values are shape names. Here are the expected keys and values.

```
Amount of sides	Shape
1	circle
2	semi-circle
3	triangle
4	square
5	pentagon
6	hexagon
7	heptagon
8	octagon
9	nonagon
10	decagon
```

2. 

Create a function that takes a whole number as input and returns the shape with that number's amount of sides. 

Note: You may use a large if/else but using object seems a lot better.
