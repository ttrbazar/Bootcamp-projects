# React-Redux NewsApi Async

In this Project you will use newsapi with your knowledge of Redux.

Let’s get started!

If you have a working React-Redux path already (or you just created a new one):

Change your original “src” folder with the Project’s “src” and run your application: npm start

## Your goals are;
- When you select a news channel from page, you should see results from newsapi.
- Use redux for storing states and fetch action.
- Use Redux Thunk middleware to make Async call. 

## STEPS:
## 1.
```
`https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?sources=${channel}&apiKey=${MY_API_KEY}`
```
Take “channel” as parameter and api key as variable.

Good Luck!
