# SPACE COLONIES

The voyagers decide that they quite like this planet, and some of them want to settle there and colonise it.


- They call the planet "Alpha" and they decide that the FAMILIES whose last names (family names) start with 'A' should stay,


- Create a function that returns an array of colonisers that will stay, according to the above rules.


- NOTE: don't include any element that is not a "family".
