# BUSH BERRIES:

The space travellers have safely landed and are foraging for food in the natural wildlife.

- There are bushes with many different colour berries.
- The pink berries are the ONLY safe ones to eat.
- If any other berries are present, it's best not to eat from the bush at all!


1. Create a function which checks if the bush has ALL PINK berries and is safe for the astronauts to eat from the bush.

Note: You can use one or more function for solution.
