# Quote Fixer

Using array methods, you will transform a string into an array!

You should consult the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) for reference on any method with which you are not familiar.

Here is quote:
> “Some body can write code that a very well designed code machines can understand. Good programmers write code that first humans can understand.” – Martin Fowler. Agile Software Design.


1. First create a variable and put this Martin Fowler’s Quote as a string. 
Use a string method to create an array and set a variable favoriteQuote. 


2. But there are some mistakes in that quote. We will fix it.
First! Check the .length of the array.
Use an array method to remove the last string of the array favoriteQuote.


3. Great! You can check your work by logging the .length of the array.
At this point, the length should be 1 less than the original length.

4. Use an array method to add the words Development, ThoughtWorks and Inc. as separate strings to the end of the favoriteQuote array.

5. Change the word body to the word fool by accessing the index and replacing it.

6. Use an array method to remove the first string of the array.

7. Use an array method to add the string Any to the beginning of the array.

8. Use an array method to remove the strings very, well, designed, code, machines, and replace them with the single string computer.

9. On one line, use console.log() and .join() to print the quote as a sentence.


> “Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.” – Martin Fowler. Learn to Program.
