# Random Quote Selector

Using array methods, you will create an array of quotes and randomly select one of them each time!

You should consult the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) for reference on any method with which you are not familiar.

Here are quotes:

> 'Beware of what you become in pursuit of what you want. - Jim Rohn';

> 'It\'s not what happens to you, but how you react to it that matters. - Epictetus';

> 'The best revenge is massive success. - Frank Sinatra';

> 'You miss 100% of the shots you don\'t take. - Wayne Gretzy';

> 'Resentment is like drinking poison and waiting for your enemies to die. - Nelson Mandela';

> 'Do not take life too seriously. You will not get out alive. - Elbert Hubbard';



1. First, create variables for each quote as a string. 

2. Now make an array consist of these variables.

Sort the array in alphabetical order.

3. Great! You can create a function to select random quote each time you called that function. 

4. Now refactor your print to something like this

Today is “SOMEDAY” and today’s quote is “SOMEQUOTE”.

First create a days array. And select random day each time. To do that use your same random function.
