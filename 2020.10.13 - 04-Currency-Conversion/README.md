# Currency Conversion

The British Company is breaking out into a new markets and need to convert prices to foreign currencies.

1. First write a function convertToUSD that converts a price to USD (exchange rate is 1.4 $ to £)

2. The business is now breaking into the Brazilian market;
Write a new function convertToBRL for converting to the Brazilian real (exchange rate is 5.7 BRL to £)
They have also decided that they should add a 1% fee to all foreign transactions (except USD), which means you only convert 99% of the £ to BRL.

3. Give different values and print this conversions to the console. Look if it is working or not.

4. Strecth this two functions in one function by using some conditionals inside. Give two arguments in it. First currency, second is value.

5. There might be some Tests that will help you work out if your code is working.
Create a function convertTest that takes tree arguments; first currency, second value, third is expected value (You can calculate expected value manually for testing).

6. Run test function for different values and see if your functions are working properly.
Congragulations.
