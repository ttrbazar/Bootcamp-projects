# FILTER ARRAY:

You are given a list of some London street names:
"Abchurch Lane", "Adam's Court", "Addle Hill", "Addle Lane", "Alban Highwalk"

1. Create a function called getLanes which takes an array as an argument

2. Function should return street names which contain 'Lane' in their name. 



Good luck!
