# FIND NEEDLE:

1.
Write a function findNeedle that takes an array full of junk but containing one "needle"

After your function finds the needle it should return a message (as a string) that says:

"found the needle at position" plus the index it found the needle at, so: 

findNeedle(['hay', 'junk', 'hay', 'hay', 'moreJunk', 'needle', 'randomJunk'])

should return "found the needle at position 5".

If couldn’t find; should return “didn’t find the needle, sorry!”

2.
Instead of finding one element (needle), add a parameter to that function so you could find different strings inside array.

For example for “cat”; it should return “found the cat at position 2”
