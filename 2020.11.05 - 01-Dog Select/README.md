# DOG INFO

1. Create an empty object called dog

2. Add name, legs, color, age and bark properties for the dog object. 

3. The bark property is a method which returns woof woof

4. Print the dog object on the console

5. Set new properties to the dog object: breed, getDogInfo

6. The getDogInfo property is a method which returns Name and Age of the dog in a string.

7. Create a method called calcAge, returning humanAge as a property of this object.

Remember our first day Project; animal years. 

Calculate humanAge according to the dog age. The formula looks like:

```
if it is 2 years old or more,
humanAge = (2 * 10.5) + (dogAge-2)*4;
if it is 1 years old, returns only 10,5 for humanAge.
```

8. Change getDogInfo return to this string:

>Example: “My name is Max. I am 33 years old in human years which is 5 years old in dog years.”
