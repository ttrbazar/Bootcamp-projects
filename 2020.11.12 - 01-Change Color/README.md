# COLOR CHANGE

## Purpose: To practice DOM

In this Project, your web page background color will be changed randomly when you clicked button on the page.

You have a colors array. Use this colors array to select random color each time.


## 1.
Create a variable button1 to select button. 

## 2.
Assign button1 clicking expression to an empty arrow function.

This function will run whenever the button is clicked.

## 3.
Inside this function ;

Create variable colorIndex and for each run create random number for it.

## 4.
Change body background color (inside) at the end of the function. Use colors array and index number to select a color.

## 5.
Refresh your page and see your page background color is changing.

## 6.

This button will change color according to hex code. Example “#ff0055”.

## 7.

## 8.
Create a variable button2 to select second button. 

Assign button2 clicking expression to an empty arrow function.

This function will run whenever the button is clicked.



## 9.
Inside this function ; make same things you did before. And assign body background color by clicking this button.
