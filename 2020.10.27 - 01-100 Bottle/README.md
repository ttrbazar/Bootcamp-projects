# 100 BOTTLE:

1. There are 100 bottles on the Wall and you hit bottles one by one. How many bottles left at the end?

Write a function that takes a number of bottles (try with 100 first).

Your function should counting the bottles fall on the ground. After every bottle fall, print a message (as a string) that says:

```
“’numberOfBottles’ bottle of milk on the Wall. Take one down, pass it around.”
```

Finish, till every bottles fall down. 

**NOTE : Use while loop.**

2. Instead of falling one by one, give a number as the function's argument. It hits that number of bottles each time and falls.

3. Why not? Take this number from user by using prompt. May be at each turn.
