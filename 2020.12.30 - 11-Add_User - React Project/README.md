# React Add User

In this Project you will add a new user by input fields to the list.

Let’s get started!

Creating new React App:

NOTE:If you have a working react path, skip this steps.

To set up react app, run the following code in your terminal, one directory up from where you want the project to live.
```
npx create-react-app react-tutorial
```
Once that finishes installing, move to the newly created directory and start the project.
```
cd react-tutorial
npm start
```
Once you run this command, a new window will popup at localhost:3000 with your new React app.
