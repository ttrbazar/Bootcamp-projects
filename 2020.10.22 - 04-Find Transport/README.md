# FIND TRANSPORT:

I am new to London and would like to know what transport I can take to different famous locations.
 
An array with London locations, and the forms of transport you can take to get there, have been provided.

Create a function which:

- Accepts an array which contains all London locations with transportation knowledge.

- Returns an array containing only the names of where I can go if I only want to use a specific mode of transport.

For example: For "river boat", result should be like this; ["Greenwich", "London Bridge"]..

NOTE: only the names should be returned, not the means of transport.
