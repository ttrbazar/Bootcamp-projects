# Mass Compare Project


## BMI comparison

With our knowledge of Javascript, let’s calculate and compare of the Mark’s and John’s BMI (Body Mass Index) with functions. As you did last week.

BMI = mass / height2 = mass / (height * height). (mass in kg and height in meter). 

1. To start, create a function calculateBMI. Calculate both their BMIs using the given formula. See that your function gives different results for given values.

2. Use console.log and string interpolation (containing the functions) to log the result something like this:

```
Mark's BMI is BMIMARK and John's BMI is BMIJOHN.
```

3. Create a function that checks if a person is underweight, normal, overweight or obese based the information given below. İt will take two arguments; BMI value and name.
- The same groups apply to both men and women.
- Underweight: BMI is less than 18.5
- Normal weight: BMI is 18.5 to 24.9
- Overweight: BMI is 25 to 29.9
- Obese: BMI is 30 or more
