# SORT ARRAY

1. Create a function called sortAges which takes an array as an argument

2. Create two arrays consist of mixed data types (strings, numbers, boolean)

3. Inside your sortAges  function remove any non-number data types without using the built-in javascript filter method.
- First, do not use for loop.
- When you finished you can use for loop. See the difference of code.

4. Returns an array of sorted numbers in ascending and descending order 

## 5. - TRY MODE – 

Create a test function that takes sortAges  function as an first argument and takes an expected array as an second argument. (create a solution array as expected array manually, for comparing)

Make comparison and give result “passed” or “failed”.


You don't have to worry about making this algorithm work fast! The idea is to get you to
"think" like a computer and practice your knowledge of basic JavaScript.


Good luck!
