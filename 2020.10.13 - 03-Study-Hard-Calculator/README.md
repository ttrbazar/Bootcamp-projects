# Study Hard Calculator ( 2 in 1 )


## Study hours calculator

The program will determine the actual and ideal hours of study for each day of the last week.
Finally, it will calculate, in hours, how far you are from your weekly study goal.


## Study points calculator

Make a new calculator (duplicate recent project) that uses different parameters not only days. Give every study time points.

- Mornings

> Our brains are the most switched-on in the first few hours of the day, and itâ€™s well worth taking advantage of this when the chance arises. How many hours a week can you dedicate to studying in the morning? Multiply this time by 2,5.

- Evenings

> Fitting in as little as half an hour of study a night can pay dividends over the course of a week. How many hours a week can you dedicate to studying in the evening? Multiply this time by 1.

- Commuting

> Mobile technology has come a long way, and a long commute on public transport can be a blessing in disguise. How many hours a week can you dedicate to study while commuting to work? Multiply this time by 2.

- Work

> Why not use your lunch break for fitting in some online study? How many hours a week can you dedicate to studying at work, particularly during your lunch break? Multiply this time by 2.

- Weekends

> Weekends are a fantastic time to fit in some longer, more focused study sessions, without neglecting your family and social life. How many hours of study can you fit into your average weekend? Multiply this time by 3.
