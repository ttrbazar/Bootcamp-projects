# PAIRS BY INDEX

You are given a program that logs pairings between two students group.

It fails because the array ` pairsByIndexRaw ` can contain different values that break the program.


1. Write a script that array items which are not pairs should be filtered out. Write pair items to another array. 

2. Create a function that print pairs of students; one from first, one from second group. To decide that grouping, use filtered array values. Hint: use .map()
